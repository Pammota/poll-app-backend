# 🗳️Gligor Polls

This is the backend for [polls.gligor.dev](polls.gligor.dev).

- It mostly uses Gin (no I don't want to use Echo, I like Gin).
- I wanted to try Redis as a database, so I used Redis as the DB.
- All my backends run in Docker containers and use CI/CD to build and deploy to my Raspberry Pi automatically.
